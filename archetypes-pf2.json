The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype are extremely useful to characters of any class. The following are just some of the possible combinations. Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect. Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion\u2019s reaction and lay on hands to go further. Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don\u2019t work. Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare. Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue\u2019s poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage. Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells.

The many domains available to clerics of different deities present a variety of options for focus spells. Alchemist clerics work well with the chirurgeon field, healing various ailments with either alchemy or spells.

The fighter archetype grants access to great feats for characters focusing on any combat style, and it\u2019s particularly helpful for characters looking to diversify their offensive abilities or focus on more powerful weapons. Barbarian fighters can combine their talents with two-handed weapons with some of the fighter\u2019s two-handed feats to devastating effect. Champion fighters focus on a style of combat exemplified by their deity. A shield-using champion benefits from the best of both worlds in shield feats. Monk fighters are great at combining unusual weapon styles. For instance, a monks isn\u2019t hindered by a restriction to keep one hand free, because they want to punch you with that hand anyway. Ranger fighters can either specialize in archery or use their fighter feats to pick up an unusual combat style combination. Rogue fighters can make good use of fighter\u2019s free hand, two-weapon fighting, or archery feats. Spellcaster fighters benefit greatly from the additional weapon proficiencies, and fighter is a solid choice for any spellcaster of a particularly martial bent."

The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character that fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks. Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can combine the barbarian\u2019s excellent unarmed damage with the monk\u2019s diverse unarmed special abilities. Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks. Fighter monks can supplement free-fighting and add mobility to the fighter\u2019s toolkit. Rogue monks are incredibly effective because stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks and flurry gives more sneak attacks. Spellcaster monks can fight with a free hand and still use material components to cast spells."

The ranger archetype has access to excellent options to improve a character\u2019s monster knowledge and survival skills, but ranger is of particular interest to any character wanting to become a dedicated archer. Alchemist rangers can add snares to their daily free items, benefiting from a strong Crafting modifier, and their Intelligence makes them exceptional with monster knowledge feats. The ranger archetype is also useful to bombers who want to alternate with in bow attacks. Champion rangers are particularly fitting for deities who connect thematically to nature or have a bow as their favored weapon. (Or, in the case of ,both!) Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome archers, combining the best archery feats from both classes to create a fighting style unique to each fighter ranger. Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged skirmishers, and snares let them be on the other side of traps for a change. Spellcaster rangers benefit greatly from ranger\u2019s feat support, backing up their spells with ranged weapon attacks. Druids have the most thematic overlap with rangers among the spellcasters, allowing you to create a true master of the wilderness."

Alchemist rogues can use the rogue\u2019s Poison Weapon to great effect with their daily poisons, and sneak attack is a nice boost to bomb damage. Barbarian rogues can become masters in every save and diversify their skills. Champion rogues add damage from sneak attack while protecting their flanking partners from harm. Fighter rogues combine the fighter\u2019s accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters. Monk rogues have great synergy, since many stances grant powerful Strikes that work with sneak attack. Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on trailing foes and catching them flat-footed. The flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the precision edge doubles down on precision damage. Spellcaster rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats like to help keep them safe."

This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack. summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a cleric who chooses an angel eidolon.

They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the or eidolons for the or order. summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style. summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey.

Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes. summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a eidolon for the . The eidolon might even be part of the story of how the sorcerer gained their bloodline. summoners are especially appreciative of an eidolon to help them in combat, and they tend to favor arcane eidolons like and construct eidolons."

Your emotional focus can change over time with you choosing a new focus after an important part of your story is resolved. Work with your GM to determine when this change happens. An emotional focus doesn't get a say in the matter; the cathartic spellcaster's emotions determine the bond. However, making another PC your emotional focus could result in an uncomfortable social dynamic. You should check with that PC's player in advance to see if such a link is acceptable. Emotions are powerful, and you can tap into that power to enhance your magic for a time. You learn to harness a particular emotional state under the right conditions, but be warned: emotions are volatile and destructive if left unchecked. The experience often leaves you reeling from the unhindered emotion, requiring a rest or distraction before tapping into it again."

Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority. Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants. Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display. The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales, and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence\u2014or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path. As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge."

This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the four elements. You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the four elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace the four elements equally as a mystical quaternity, and they strengthen their connection to one of these elements each day to protect themselves from harm.

You're a spellcaster that's specialized in harnessing the four elements. Though you might feel a stronger kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping all of them.

Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the or spell list. You don\u2019t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats.

You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.

            "description": "Call of Shadows The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear\u2014fear of the dark, fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling. In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows. Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but not without its champions for good and even law, though it is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between. Shadow has always been the cousin of fear. Within the darkness, monsters dwell, plans are hatched, and enemies strike with fang and dagger and dark magic. But some embrace the shadow, gain power from it, and dance within its shifting dark. A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal. Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn, gradually transforming them into something inky, nebulous, and mysterious.

You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. : You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire. : You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways. You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1. A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). You can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check. When your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so. Roll 1d20 and use Table 5\u20132: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead. If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies. A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects."
