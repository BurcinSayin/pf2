The GM determines what it is, or whether there's nothing reasonable to pick up, skipping obvious clues that can be easily noticed without a check or specifically looking for them. You learn only that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it's suspicious. For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it's evident to you already, so the GM might note that there's something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out what specifically is out of the ordinary. That's Odd doesn't reveal whether creatures are suspicious.  You don't typically get any benefit when you leave and come back to a place, though if a major change has happened there and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do."

When you Cast a Spell that doesn't have a spell attack roll as part of a Spellstrike, it works in the following ways.  If your Strike critically fails, the spell is lost with no effect. Creatures use their normal defenses against the spell, such as saving throws. If the spell lets you select a number of targets, it instead targets only the creature you attacked with your Strike. If the spell has an area, the target must be in that area. A burst is centered on a corner of the target's square, or the square corner closest to the center of the target, if the target is Large or larger; you choose the corner if more than one is eligible. A cone or line emits from you and must include the target; if you're not adjacent to the target (using a reach weapon or starlit span, for example), choose any square adjacent to the target as the source. The spell affects all creatures in the area as normal, but the Strike still targets only one creature."

The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it's prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat. Similarly, one place might count as multiple types of terrain, such as a mountain in the far north being both arctic and mountain. In this case, you choose only one terrain attunement effect, even if the spell has traits that would apply to each terrain type. Certain terrain attunements affect your enemies instead of you. If they do, when you cast the spell you apply the listed effect to all enemies who are either adjacent to you, in the area of the spell, or targeted by the spell. These enemies receive the listed saving throw against your spell DC to attempt to avoid the effect.  Aquatic (water) You ride the currents of water.

If you're on a surface, temporary waves of water follow your movements, allowing you to use your swim Speed\u2014if you have one\u2014as your land Speed. Arctic (cold) Arctic rime covers your foes' bodies. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. They take a \u20135-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 2 rounds (\u201310-foot on a critical failure). Desert (fire) The scorching heat of the desert dehydrates your foes. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, they're fatigued until they drink water or another potable liquid. Forest (plant) Branches and vines reach out to get in your foes' way. Enemies must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, they become clumsy 1 for 1 round (clumsy 2 on a critical failure). Mountain (earth) The rugged endurance of the mountain protects you from harm. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to the spell level for 1 round. Plains (plant) The growing fields and pulsing vitality of the plains provide you vigor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level for 1 round. Sky (air) A gust of wind carries you aloft. You can Fly up to 10 feet. If you're in the air at the end of the turn and don't have a fly Speed, you fall. Swamp (plant) Your magic draws in noxious swamp gas to fumigate your foes. Affected foes take persistent poison damage equal to half the spell's level (minimum 1 damage) with a basic Fortitude save. Underground (earth) The endless darkness of the cavern depths opens up its secrets to your senses. For 1 round, you gain darkvision as well as imprecise tremorsense out to 15 feet.

You can start to Juggle with a single stored item, an item you were carrying, or an unattended item within your reach. The item must be of light or negligible Bulk. You Juggle the item until the end of your next turn, unless you use this feat against next turn to continue Juggling (see below). While you are Juggling, you can use this action again to add another item to the Juggle, which must meet all the same requirements. You can Juggle a number of items equal to one more than the number of hands you are using to Juggle.  You can also use this action to continue Juggling as long as you aren\u2019t fatigued. When you do, you continue to Juggle until the end of your next turn. If you do not continue Juggling by the end of your turn, you cease Juggling and you drop all the items. You become fatigued if you continue Juggling for more than 10 minutes (60 rounds) within the course of an hour.  As long as you\u2019re Juggling fewer than your maximum number of items, you have a free hand. You can wield weapons you are Juggling (but not shields or other items) as long as they can be wielded in one hand. For example, while you Juggle a dagger in one hand and wield a shield in the other, you are wielding the dagger but still have a free hand to Cast a Spell with a material component. Juggling two or more weapons with one hand doesn\u2019t allow you to use feats that require two weapons each held in a different hand."

Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a  Seek  action to attempt a Perception check against your  Deception  DC, as if you were using the  Impersonate  action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity\u2014a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.  Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.  Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to  Recall Knowledge  about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the  detect alignment  spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.  To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits:  social  or  vigilante . You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.  You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype."

Other than taking the form of an  elemental  instead of an animal, this familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars.  Your familiar gains one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following elemental familiar abilities. While your familiar has an elemental familiar ability, your familiar is composed of the associated elemental matter and gains the matching elemental trait. You can't select more than one elemental familiar ability at a time.  Air If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes invisible until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect. Earth Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to half your level. Fire Your familiar sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and emits warmth. Creatures that remain within a 15-foot emanation don't take damage from severe environmental cold. Water Your familiar can move through a gap at least 2 inches wide without Squeezing and can Squeeze through a gap at least 1 inch wide."

The first time you attempt this action within the next minute in a context the GM deems both suitably challenging and meaningful, you must roll twice and use the lower result. If you succeed at this check, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to attempt the same action for 10 minutes. If you fail this check or don\u2019t attempt the action within 1 minute, you instead take a \u20131 circumstance penalty on checks to attempt the same action for 1 hour.  If the chosen action can be used with multiple skills, such as  Identify Magic  or Recall Knowledge, you must specify which skill you are using for that particular action, such as using  Arcana  to Identify Magic, and your bonus or penalty after the boast applies only to checks using that skill for that action. Once you declare a boast about a particular action, you cannot declare a boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check.  Typically a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action\u2019s success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals, rather than a boast you made simply to gain a bonus later.  You can\u2019t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Firebrand Braggart archetype."

A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else."

Nature allows you to contact the spirits of nature that form  leshies , who are born of pure life essence rather than spiritual energy and can answer questions about natural features like the location of nearby water or plant life. Religion reveals the presence of  angelic ,  demonic , or other spirits in service to divine beings, who provide information about sources of powerful positive or negative energy, sacred or profane influences, or the presence of undead. Occultism allows you to contact lingering spirits, psychic echoes of the departed dead, and spirits from beyond reality, who tell you about things like strange auras, effects, or the presence of unnatural occult beings.  Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to  Recall Knowledge  with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually a very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you might encounter in the area). If you're legendary in the chosen skill, you can use this feat once per hour, instead of only once per day, but you can't use it again on any area that overlaps a previous area.  You can select this feat multiple times, each time picking a different skill in which you have the master proficiency rank. You can use this feat with each skill once per day (or once per hour, if you're legendary).  The spirits reveal themselves to you and have a  helpful  attitude toward you. Only you can perceive these spirits. They answer three simple questions about the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact. Their answers are almost always a single word, and their knowledge is limited to within their area of interest.  As with a critical success, but the spirits are  indifferent  to you and answer only one question.  You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.  You contact one or more malevolent spirits. They are  hostile  toward you, though they may not immediately appear so. They answer up to three questions but give you information that is harmful to you in some way, as determined by the GM."

If the spell requires an attack roll, use the higher of the target's AC or their Will DC. If the spell requires a saving throw, the target uses their Will saving throw or the spell's normal saving throw, whichever is higher. Each time a creature fails its saving throw against a spell cast from your reservoir, you gain a small tattoo inked on your flesh out of pure shadowstuff.
