            "description": "For some, the nuts and bolts of keeping the peace are practically second nature. Such is the case for you, a member of the Learned Guard with an incredible mind for investigation as well as a gift for understanding magic. You probably aren't a hit with your peers, who find your intellect and natural gift of deduction perhaps a bit off-putting, but when left to your own devices you excel, and you get along well with professors and mages such as those who work in Forae Logos or the Arcanamirium.  After no shortage of debating the pros and cons, you decided to transfer to the Edgewatch precinct. Sure, you have a keen understanding of the theories and principles behind law enforcement, but you've reasoned that in order to be a truly effective guard you'll need some first-hand experience in a high-risk area nabbing suspects and protecting innocents- all the while taking fastidious notes and writing your grand thesis on the merits and shortcomings of Absalom's laws.  Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.  You're trained in your choice of the Arcana or Occultism skill, as well as Legal Lore. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks to interact with Learned Guards and with academics such as librarians and scholars. You gain the Recognize Spell skill feat.",

            "description": "Like your parents and your parents before them, you initially followed the long path toward politics from an early age. Your close association with Absalom's upper echelons put you in touch with the city's various military or special operations units-the First Guard, the Wave Riders, the Varlokkur- though you avoided any actual duty with these groups. Thanks to your strict upbringing and the connections of your family, you soon became a lauded and highly respected member of Absalom's political elite. But you couldn't stifle a certain feeling that you were destined for more than simply filling the pointed shoes of your forebears. Despite your easily earned accolades and a relatively cushy life as a young lawyer or councilmember, you sought to do more with your diplomatic training and not live out the exact same life as your ancestors.  Your decision to transfer to the Edgewatch has rubbed your traditionalist family the wrong way, and they've cut off the financial aid they've provided you your whole life. But you don't care-you know you're doing the right thing by taking on the rough jobs of a low-ranking guard, and you're ready to shine based on your own merits, not those of your lofty kin.  Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.  You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and Legal Lore.

            "description": "Not all cops are passionate about their jobs. For some, the pursuit of justice is just another way to pay the bills. Honestly, it was probably the Post Guard's generous time-off policy that drew you to their service, and during your yearly sabbaticals you've dabbled in hobbies as diverse as fishing, baking, or even stand-up comedy. Even while on duty, you're probably idly fiddling with a lucky coin or practicing magic tricks with a deck of cards. You probably irritate your fellow guards a bit with your non sequiturs, casual attitude, and tendency to daydream, but results don't lie, and more often than not you prove your worth when the chips are down.  For all the excitement of guarding Absalom's Postern Gate, the Post Guard wasn't really the right fit for someone as distractible as yourself, so your boss put in a 'promotion' for you to transfer to the newly formed Edgewatch. You're all for the reassignment, since it will put you smack in the middle of the most entertaining and diverse gathering of the century, the Radiant Festival.  Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.  You're trained in the Performance skill, a Lore skill of your choice, and you gain a bonus language.

A supervisor took mercy on you and offered to transfer you to another guard unit in the city, promising that you'd have a place on the Sally Guard when you decided you were ready for the challenge.
